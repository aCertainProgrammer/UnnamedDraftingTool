CURRENT WORK:

- fearless:
    a) make draft state saving into an array << DONE
    b) allow having several drafts open << DONE
        - toggle copying the last draft into the new slot button << DONE
    c) add a fearless toggle to disable picks << DONE
        - have a disabledChampions array for every draft based on the drafts that came before it (in the backend probably) << DONE
    d) add a toggle to allow all champions for last draft
    e) switch team colors for each subsequent draft (make it togglable)
    f) remove invalid champions from subsequent drafts << DONE
    g) Add support for saving all drafts at once

THEN:

SHORT IDEAS:

- consider tooltips or something like that for binds

LONG IDEAS:

- allow data presets for snapshots and data

BUGS:

- Not a bug but good to remember and think about:
When you leave the mouse in the middle of the champions, then search, unless you have only 1 champ remaining, when you press a button 0-9 it will pick your last hovered champion (quite random if you were just searching), this is due to hover being stronger than non-explicit search and can be confusing
