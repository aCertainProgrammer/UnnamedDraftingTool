CURRENT WORK:

- style hiding buttons better
THEN:

SHORT IDEAS:

- consider tooltips or something like that for binds

- be more explicit about requiring shift for shortcuts?

- allow naming drafts

- find better colors for team/enemy redblue

LONG IDEAS:

- fearless

- allow data presets for snapshots and data

BUGS:

- Not a bug but good to remember and think about:
When you leave the mouse in the middle of the champions, then search, unless you have only 1 champ remaining, when you press a button 0-9 it will pick your last hovered champion (quite random if you were just searching), this is due to hover being stronger than non-explicit search and can be confusing
