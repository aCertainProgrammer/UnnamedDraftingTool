CURRENT WORK:

- fearless:
    a) make draft state saving into an array
    b) allow having several drafts open
    c) add a fearless toggle to disable picks
        - have a disabledChampions array for every draft based on the drafts that came before it (in the backend probably)
    d) add a toggle to allow all champions for last draft

THEN:

SHORT IDEAS:

- consider tooltips or something like that for binds

- be more explicit about requiring shift for shortcuts?

- find better colors for team/enemy redblue

LONG IDEAS:

- allow data presets for snapshots and data

BUGS:

- Not a bug but good to remember and think about:
When you leave the mouse in the middle of the champions, then search, unless you have only 1 champ remaining, when you press a button 0-9 it will pick your last hovered champion (quite random if you were just searching), this is due to hover being stronger than non-explicit search and can be confusing
