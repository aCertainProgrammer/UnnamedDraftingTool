CURRENT WORK:

THEN:

SHORT IDEAS:

- add setting to clear champs on page reload

- fix binds for weird keyboards

- figure out bundling etc

- fix shortcuts missing in the manual 

LONG IDEAS:

- GUI for making champion pools

- Data presets 

- Comfort level indicator for champions (border coloring repurposed?)

- Add a pickbanggwebapp-like minimap with picked champions (on another screen like menu/manual?)

- add themes with different color palletes

BUGS:

- Not a bug but good to remember and think about:
When you leave the mouse in the middle of the champions, then search, unless you have only 1 champ remaining, when you press a button 0-9 it will pick your last hovered champion (quite random if you were just searching), this is due to hover being stronger than non-explicit search and can be confusing
