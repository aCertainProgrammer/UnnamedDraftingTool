BUGS:

- Not a bug but good to remember and think about:
When you leave the mouse in the middle of the champions, then search, unless you have only 1 champ remaining, when you press a button 0-9 it will pick your last hovered champion (quite random if you were just searching), this is due to hover being stronger than non-explicit search and can be confusing
